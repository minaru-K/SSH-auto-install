# install it:
# sudo apt install sshpass

# change /.ssh/config (for connection with password Without our intervention):
# StrictHostKeyChecking = no
# UserKnownHostsFile = /dev/null

# restart ssh-service (to apply changes):
# sudo systemctl restart sshd

# sudo chmod +x schript
                     
# Save files for install in /ssh_downloads and start ./script
                     
# How does the script work?
# script
# 1. In the SSH_Downloads folder, we save all the files that we need to install on customer machines
# 2. Save the name of all files for installation in the files file
# 3. Using ARP --A we get all available customers and save them in the SSH_IPTEMP file
# 4. We extract from the output of ARP -A only IP addresses and save them ssh_ip, delete the temporary file
# 5. Run the cycle by IP addresses from the file, connect to each host on a predetermined route password* and transfer files for installation with the Script_For_Client script script

# script_for_client
# 1. It is performed directly on the clientâ€™s device, without stopping the transfer of files.
# 2. In the cycle reads the name of the files for installation and starts installing
# 3. also writes out a report on errors if they occur, saving the file in the form of [IP address] .log
# Ready

# In the form of a root password - YES, it is as UNSAFE as possible.
# Since the password is transmitted in open form, it can easily be intercepted. I plan to fix it. The script was written in conditions of limited time, just to work out. The best option would be to use SSH key.
